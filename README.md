# Hello-world
Standard Hello World warm-up exercise
This is my Hello World project.  I've used source management tools in the past, of course, but I want a little experience with GitHub because it's a popular source management tool.  Plus, I'm a bit rusty. ;-)

My alias comes from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Princess Ida."  The misanthropic King Gama sings a song about how frustrated he is that everyone is being nice to him he doesn't have anything to complain about anymore.

"When German bands from music stands played Wagner imper-fect-ly,
I bade them go; they didn't say no, but off they went directly!
The organ boys they stopped their noise with readiness surprising
And grinning herds of hurdy-gurds retired, apologising!"
